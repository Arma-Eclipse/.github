Welcome to the Arma Eclipse GitHub organization — the development hub for the Arma Eclipse server project for Arma 3. This organization manages and maintains all systems powering the Eclipse experience: a detailed, player-driven role-play environment built around realism, depth, and community involvement.

# About the Project

Arma Eclipse is a custom Arma 3 Life framework designed exclusively for internal use by the Eclipse development team. Our goal is to deliver an optimized, immersive, and polished gameplay experience through carefully crafted mission logic, balanced systems, and high-quality vehicle and asset configurations.

**What We Develop**

* Core mission systems including economy, policing, factions, and civilian life.

* Server-side functionality: database integration, admin tools, and backend scripts.

* Vehicle and asset configurations — including utilities, K9 units, and fleet vehicles.

* Developer utilities, testing tools, and internal documentation.

**Development Standards**

All changes follow a strict version-controlled workflow:

* Features are peer-reviewed before merge.

* Code is tested internally prior to deployment.

* Releases are tagged and archived for traceability.

**Organization Structure**

* Mission – Core gameplay scripts and logic.

* Server-Addons – Private server-side tools and backend systems.

* VehicleConfigs – Fleet and vehicle configuration files.

* InternalDocs – Development documentation and setup guides for staff.
